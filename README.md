LittleStat
==========

Little Stat is a computation engine for table top role playing games. It's able to calculate character/npc/mob stats, roll dice, calculate battle damage and manage inventory. Think of it as the best video RPG you've ever played.. without the story elements. The idea of Little Stat is to create a flexible, complex, yet easy to use number cruncher that does all the hard work and lets you get back to pure role playing..
